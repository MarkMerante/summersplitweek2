# Laning Phase vs. Objectives
I have made an analysis involving the game 'League Of Legends'. In this analysis, I have investigated whether the laning phase heavily affects the outcome of a game over objectives. I have used methods such as correlation analysis and logistic regression to help aide my analysis. I have gathered data from professional league of legends games to make this analysis possible.
